# mqtt React Panel

This is just a stub to show how you can create a basic visualization plugin.

First, install dependencies:

```BASH
yarn install
```

To work with this plugin run:

```BASH
yarn dev
```

or

```BASH
yarn watch
```

This will run linting tools and apply prettier fix.

To build the plugin run:

```BASH
yarn build
```
